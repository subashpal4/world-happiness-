# world-happiness-report
The World Happiness Report from the UN offers valuable insights into the
state of happiness globally. The data is collected from people in more than 150
countries, this dataset includes various factors contributing to a nation's well-being,
encompassing economic indicators, social support, life expectancy, perceptions of
corruption, and freedom of choice.
This project delves into the World Happiness Reports from 2005 to 2022,
aiming to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends that illuminate the key
contributors to a country's happiness. Through data visualization and statistical
analysis, we seek to understand how variables like Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
perceptions of corruption, and freedom influence overall happiness levels.
Our journey begins with data preprocessing, addressing missing values,
encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. We then explore
relationships through insightful comparison plots, focusing not only on the top 20
countries overall but also on the top 10 countries within each region for a nuanced
perspective.
The analytical approach involves scatter plots, correlation matrices, and
feature importance analyses to unravel connections between happiness and its
determinants.
